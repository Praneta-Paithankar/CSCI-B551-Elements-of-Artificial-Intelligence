Problem 1:Pichu

Let’s consider Pichu, a somewhat simplified version of Chess that is popular among a certaincommunity of midwestern bird enthusiasts.
The game is played by two players on a board consisting of a grid of 8×8 squares.Initially, each playerhas sixteen pieces:  
8 Parakeets, 2 Robins, 2 Nighthawks, 2 Blue jays, 1 Quetzal, and 1 Kingfisher.

The two players alternate turns, with White going first.On each turn, a player moves exactly one of his or her pieces,possibly capturing (removing) a piece of the opposite player in the process, according to the following rules:

• A Parakeet may move one square forward,  if no other piece is on that square.Or,  a Parakeet maymove one square forward diagonally (one square forward and one square left or right) if a piece of the opposite player is on that square, in the process capturing that piece from the board. If a Parakeet reaches the far row of the board (closest to the opposite player), it is transformed into a Quetzal. On its very first move of the game, a Parakeet may move forward two squares as long as both are empty.
